# busted


Being Busted refers to the player being arrested by the police or any other type of law enforcement in a Grand Theft Auto game. The player can only get busted if they are wanted by the police. If the player has a high wanted level, the police will then try to kill the player rather than arrest them, resulting in the player being wasted, if killed.
